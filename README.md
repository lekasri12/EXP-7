# Supply Chain Transparency for Luxury Goods
## NAME: LEKASRI G
## REGISTER NUMBER: 212223100025
# Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
# Algorithm:
1.Identify stakeholders involved in the luxury goods supply chain.

2.Set up a blockchain network to record and share supply chain data.

3.Develop smart contracts to automate tracking and verification processes.

4.Assign unique digital IDs (e.g., QR/RFID) to each luxury product.

5.Record product data at every supply chain stage into the blockchain.

6.Enable consumer access to product history via a web or mobile app.

7.Monitor and improve the system through audits and feedback.


# Program:
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
contract LuxurySupplyChain {
struct Product {
string name;
address currentOwner;
bool verified;
}
mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;
event ProductRegistered(uint256 productId, string name);
event OwnershipTransferred(uint256 productId, address newOwner);
function registerProduct(uint256 productId, string memory name) public {
require(products[productId].currentOwner == address(0), "Product already registered");
products[productId] = Product(name, msg.sender, true);
emit ProductRegistered(productId, name);
}
function transferOwnership(uint256 productId, address newOwner) public {
require(products[productId].currentOwner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
products[productId].currentOwner = newOwner;
emit OwnershipTransferred(productId, newOwner);
}
function verifyProduct(uint256 productId) public view returns (string memory,
address, bool) {
Product memory p = products[productId];
return (p.name, p.currentOwner, p.verified);
}
}

```
# Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a car) is registered on-chain.

Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.

Buyers can check the authenticity before purchasing.

# High-Level Overview:
Helps prevent counterfeit luxury goods.


Teaches real-world supply chain use cases.

# RESULT : 
Hence we implemented code for a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
